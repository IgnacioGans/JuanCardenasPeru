MANU NATIONAL PARK CULTURAL ZONE
Archaeology & Birding Cusco - Peru

by  Juan  Cardenas 



Manu is a truly remarkable reserve, of over 1.5 million wild hectares, falling from 4500 metres above sea level to the  Amazon basin. It is one of the world’s biodiversity hot spots, with 200 mammal species, over 1000 each of bird and butterfly species, and 15,000 plants.  And of course Manu does not have a coast line!   It is divided into three sectors. By far the largest is the National Park, open only to permitted researchers and indigenous inhabitants. The Cultural Zone is open to all, with very little forest protection. This is as far as most tourists venture, and where we  hall commence our river journey on the Madre de Dios at Atalaya, the road’s end. The Reserved Zone is deep in the rainforest, along the Manu River upstream from its confluence with Madre de Dios at Boca Manu. The only permitted activities here are scientific research and tourism; access however is only possible with authorized and environmentally trained guides.
We enter the buffer zone as we cross the range, at 3500m in the stunted elfin forest, right on the tree line. As we descend we drop into the dripping cloud forest. And forest is not just forest – roughly every 500 metres of descent brings a substantially different suite of birds, and of course other animals and plants. By the time we reach the lowland western Amazon rainforests we are in an area which claims the highest terrestrial bird density on earth, and over 500 bird species. The rivers  provide excellent wildlife watching, and the associated oxbow lakes (we would call them billabongs) provide another habitat in its own right. Different bird species specialise in bamboo thickets, and riverside scrubs. 
DAY 1: CUSCO - CLOUD FOREST - WAYQUECHA LODGE
Manu is a vast rainforest area east of the Andes, including the mountain slopes and Amazon lowlands. A spectacular drive into the high puna grasslands, to cross the Andes 4000 meters above sea level. At the summit we enter the Manu Biosphere Reserve and descend into the rich cloud forest. Basic dormitory-style accommodations in ACCA research station 3000 meters above sea level. See: http://www.acca.org.pe/nuestras-estaciones-biologicas/wayqecha-ebw 
DAY 2: WAYQUECHA LODGE TO SAN PEDRO LODGE
Morning nature walks to view wildlife at the Wayquecha Research Station and later a superb walk in the cloud forest for birds and orchids; Scarlet Mountain-tanagers are real stars! Afternoon drive down the mountain with stops as required. Accommodation in a riverside rainforest lodge at 1500 masl. Overnigt in a lodge at San Pedro (B,L,D,)
DAY 3: SAN PEDRO LODGE
A full day in the San Pedro zone, with several activities during the day. Another overnight at San Pedro.  (B,L,D,)
DAY 4: SAN PEDRO LODGE TO AMAZONIA LODGE
Early start to see the Cock-of-the-Rock. We then continue the descent through forest and farmland, to the river port of Atalaya, where we board our large, covered, motorised canoes and head down the Alto Madre de Dios River to our rainforest lodge. Over the next week the canoes give excellent opportunities for watching wildlife, including numerous birds and monkeys; Red Howlers, Dusky Titis, Capuchins and Squirrel Monkeys are all present in this section, and various kingfishers, herons, vultures, toucans and macaws can be seen from the river. Optional night walk to nearby lake. Accommodation in Amazonia rainforest lodge, a gracious former tea plantation. Overnight at Amazonia Lodge.  See: http://www.amazonialodge.com  (B,L,D,)
DAY 5: AMAZONIA LODGE
A full day at Amazonia Lodge, including macaw and parrot clay licks, oxbow lakes, etc. Another overnight at Amazonia Lodge. (B,L,D,) 
​DAY 6: AMAZONIA LODGE TO BLANQUILLO MACAW CLAY LICK
After breakfast, we will travel even further downstream. On the banks will be Horned Screamers, Orinoco Geese, Rufescent tiger heron, kingfishers and many flocks of birds. We will have lunch in the boat. Today we’ll be cruising down the Manu and Alto Madre de Dios Rivers past Boca Manu town where we will restock and visit a tradItional boat builder before resuming a wonderful seven hour voyage to the private Blanquillo Reserve, with airy rooms set in beautiful and birdsome gardens on the river bank. Overnight at Blanquillo Lodge. (B,L,D,) See: http://www.manuwildlifecenter.com or http://tamboblanquillo.com/reserve
DAY 7: BLANQUILLO or MANU WILDLIFE CENTER
An early morning start for one of the highlights of our trip, some hours in a large raised hide at the largest macaw lick in the area. We should see hundreds of at least eight parrot species, including scores of magnificent Red-and-Green Macaws, with other sightings as a bonus. Afternoon transfer to the close Manu Wild life Center MWC Lodge, rainforest walks are optional, and at sunset we shall take a short walk to the River bank. Overnight at the same lodge (B,L,D,) 
DAY 8 LODGE TO PUERTO MALDONADO BACK TO CUSCO OR LIMA
Early morning start as flocks of birds pass over the boat, and we may see a Capybara, the world's largest rodent. Our destination Boca Colorado, a frontier gold rush town, where we'll take local transport for an hour to the Inambari river and by paved road to Puerto Maldonado in order to catch the afternoon Commercial LAN Airbus flight to Cusco (OR LIMA IF YOU PREFERED) . On arrival at around 3:00 pm we'll drop you at your hotel AT CUSCO OR LIMA B,L.

Archaeology & Birding Cusco - Peru

by  Juan  Cardenas 



My family and I spent 10 days in Peru in October 2013 and had the trip of a lifetime. We visited the Sacred Valley on our way to the famed Machu Picchu site, trekked to the base of  a glacier in the Salkantay region and visited several of the historical sites in and around Cusco. Archeology and Birding made this the perfect trip...
